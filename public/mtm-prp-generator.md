# Meet the Moment Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) Generator

## Overview
A streamlined framework for defining product requirements for nonprofit web applications using Meet the Moment's standard tech stack.

---

## Introduction Script

Hey! Let's map out your product vision together. I'll ask focused questions to understand what you're building and who it serves.

Since we're using our standard MTM tech stack (GitHub, Netlify, Supabase), we can skip the technical debates and focus on making something that actually works for your mission.

Ready? Let's build something meaningful.

## Interview Questions

### 1. Mission & Problem Context
- What problem are you solving?
- Who's most affected by this problem?
- How does this advance your mission?
- What's broken about the current approach?

### 2. Users & Access
- Who are your primary users? (staff, beneficiaries, volunteers, donors?)
- Will this be internal-only or public-facing?
- What's their tech comfort level (1-10)?
- Any accessibility requirements we should know about?

### 3. Core User Journey
- How does someone first find/access this tool?
- What's the main thing they need to accomplish?
- How do they know they've succeeded?
- What happens next (retention/follow-up)?

### 4. Features (MVP Focus)

**MUST-HAVE for launch:**
- [ ] What data do users need to input?
- [ ] What do they need to see/retrieve?
- [ ] Any automated processes needed?
- [ ] Reporting/export requirements?

**NICE-TO-HAVE (Phase 2):**
- [ ] What would make this delightful vs. just functional?
- [ ] Future automation opportunities?

### 5. Data & Content
- What information will the system store?
- Any sensitive/PII data? (affects our approach)
- Who can see what? (access levels needed?)
- Data retention needs? (how long to keep records?)
- Any compliance requirements? (HIPAA, FERPA, etc.)

### 6. Authentication Needs

**Pick one:**
- [ ] Public (no auth needed)
- [ ] Simple password (one password for all users)
- [ ] Basic user accounts (if absolutely necessary)

**If auth is needed:**

- [ ] Professional & institutional
- [ ] Playful & engaging

**Brand assets:**

- Any specific fonts? (or use system fonts)

### 8. Content Management
- Who will update content after launch?
- How often will content change?
- Need a simple admin interface?
- Or comfortable updating via GitHub?

### 9. Success & Metrics
- What does success look like in 3 months?
- What metrics matter? (usage, outcomes, or both?)
- How will you know if this isn't working?
- Reporting needs for board/funders?

### 10. Timeline & Resources
- When do you need this live? (be honest)
- Who's the main point person?
- Who else needs to be involved?

## Usage Instructions

### For Interviewers

1. **Start with context:** Explain this is a collaborative process to ensure we build the right thing.

2. **Take notes during conversation:** Don't make it feel like a formal questionnaire.

3. **Skip irrelevant sections:** Not every project needs every question answered.

4. **Focus on outcomes:** Keep bringing conversation back to impact and user value.

5. **Be realistic about timelines:** Most MVPs can launch in 3-4 weeks with focused scope.

### For Developers

1. **Review before starting:** Make sure all critical questions are answered.

2. **Flag gaps early:** If something crucial is missing, ask before building.

3. **Use standard stack:** Don't deviate from GitHub/Netlify/Supabase without good reason.

4. **Follow MTM style guide:** Reference mtm-style-guide.md for all design decisions.

5. **Document as you build:** Update the PRP with any significant changes.

### For Clients

1. **Be honest about resources:** Better to know constraints upfront.

2. **Focus on MVP:** We can always add features after launch.

3. **Identify your champion:** Someone needs to own this internally.

4. **Plan for maintenance:** Even simple apps need occasional updates.

5. **Define success clearly:** Vague goals lead to disappointed stakeholders.

## Red Flags to Watch For

ðŸš© **"We need it to do everything"** â†’ Focus on ONE core problem first

ðŸš© **"Can we make it like Facebook/Amazon/etc?"** â†’ Reference simpler alternatives

ðŸš© **"We don't know who will use it"** â†’ Need user research first

ðŸš© **"The board wants AI"** â†’ Define specific use case, not just "AI"

ðŸš© **"We need it next week"** â†’ Set realistic expectations

ðŸš© **"Multiple departments have different needs"** â†’ Start with one department's MVP

ðŸš© **"We'll figure out maintenance later"** â†’ Address sustainability upfront
